            <strong>WHAT IS STRESS ?</strong>
            <br /> Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure. Stress is our body's response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new , unexpected or that threatens our sense of self , or when we feel we have little control over a situation.   <br />

            <h3>WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF STRESS ?</h3>

            <b><u> How you might feel ?</b></u>
            <br />You may feel:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Anxious</li>
                <li>Afraid</li>

                <li>Depressed</li>
            </ul>
            These feelings can sometimes produce physical symptoms, making you feel even worse.

            <br /> <b><u>How you might behave ?</u></b><br />
            <br /> You may behave differently if you’re stressed. You may:<br />
            <ul>
                <li> Withdraw from other people or snap at them</li>
                <li> Be indecisive or inflexible</li>
                <li>Be tearful</li>
                <li>Have problems getting to sleep or staying asleep</li>
                <li>Experience sexual problems</li>
                <li> Smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs more than usual</li>
            </ul>
            <br /> <b><u> How your body might react ?</b></u><br />
            <br /> If you’re stressed, you may experience:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>  Headaches</li>
                <li>  Nausea</li>
                <li>  Indigestion</li>
                <li>  Shallow breathing or hyperventilating</li>
                <li> Sweating</li>
                <li> Heart palpitations</li>
                <li>  Aches and pains.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />   If the stress is long-lasting, you may notice your sleep and memory are affected, your eating habits change, or you feel less inclined to exercise.
            This concept and technical handle has been developed by a team of three friends who are currently persuing Bachelors in technology from
            a university in India . They are ambitious and passionate about using their skills to help people in many ways.  <br />

            <h4>HOW TO DEAL WITH STRESS !!</h4>

            1. Re-balance Work and Home

            <br /> All work and no play? If you’re spending too much time at the office, intentionally put more dates in your calendar to enjoy time for fun, either alone or with others.<br />

            2. Build in Regular Exercise

            <br />   Moving your body on a regular basis balances the nervous system and increases blood circulation, helping to flush out stress hormones. Even a daily 20-minute walk makes a difference.<br />

            3. Eat Well and Limit Alcohol and Stimulants

            <br /> Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine may temporarily relieve stress but have negative health impacts and can make stress worse in the long run. Well-nourished bodies cope better, so start with a good breakfast, add more organic fruits and vegetables, avoid processed foods and sugar, and drink more water.<br />

            4. Connect with Supportive People

            <br />   Talking face to face with another person releases hormones that reduce stress. Lean on those good listeners in your life.<br />

            5. Carve out Hobby Time

            <br />  Do you enjoy gardening, reading, listening to music or some other creative pursuit? Engage in activities that bring you pleasure and joy; research shows that reduces stress by almost half and lowers your heart rate, too.<br />

            6. Practice Meditation, Stress Reduction or Yoga

            <br />  Relaxation techniques activate a state of restfulness that counterbalances your body’s fight-or-flight hormones. Consider taking a mindfulness-based stress reduction course to learn effective, lasting tools.<br />

            7. Sleep Enough

            <br />  If you get less than seven to eight hours of sleep, your body won’t tolerate stress as well as it could. If stress keeps you up at night, address the cause and add extra meditation into your day to make up for the lost z’s.<br />

            8. Bond with Your Pet

            <br />  Clinical studies show that spending even a short time with a companion animal can cut anxiety levels almost in half.<br />

            9. Take a Vacation

            <h5>BEST EXERCISES TO REDUCE STRESS AT HOME:</h5>

            1. Yoga
            <br />One of the best stress relief exercises to try at home is Yoga. Not only is yoga easy to practice at home but it also enhances our mental focus, which is key to managing stress. When stress swipes in our mind it loses its calm and clouds of chaos hovers.<br />

            2. Tai Chi
            <br /> Tai Chi has its origin from Chinese martial art, also known as, Tai Chi Chuan. It is often described as “meditation in motion.” This is a low-impact exercise that comprises a series of gentle and fluid movements, linked with your breath. <br />

            3. Qigong
            <br />Qigong is a stress reducing exercise that is similar to Tai Chi. It is a Chinese martial art technique. It is not a heart-pumping workout that puts our body in movement; rather it is a meditative and deliberate approach for the same.<br />

            4. Walking
            <br />Probably one of the easiest and cost-effective exercises to relieve stress is walking! Trust me even if you are walking within the house, balcony, the little backyard that you have, you are going to rejoice the benefits that it has to offer. Studies have time and again showed that people with regular walking regimens tend to report a lower level of stress as compared to those who don’t have walking as a part of their lifestyle.<br />
