            <strong>WHAT IS STRESS ?</strong>

            <h4>HOW TO DEAL WITH STRESS !!</h4>

            1. Re-balance Work and Home

            <br /> All work and no play? If you’re spending too much time at the office, intentionally put more dates in your calendar to enjoy time for fun, either alone or with others.<br />

            2. Build in Regular Exercise

            <br />   Moving your body on a regular basis balances the nervous system and increases blood circulation, helping to flush out stress hormones. Even a daily 20-minute walk makes a difference.<br />

            3. Eat Well and Limit Alcohol and Stimulants

            <br /> Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine may temporarily relieve stress but have negative health impacts and can make stress worse in the long run. Well-nourished bodies cope better, so start with a good breakfast, add more organic fruits and vegetables, avoid processed foods and sugar, and drink more water.<br />

            4. Connect with Supportive People

            <br />   Talking face to face with another person releases hormones that reduce stress. Lean on those good listeners in your life.<br />

            5. Carve out Hobby Time

            <br />  Do you enjoy gardening, reading, listening to music or some other creative pursuit? Engage in activities that bring you pleasure and joy; research shows that reduces stress by almost half and lowers your heart rate, too.<br />

            6. Practice Meditation, Stress Reduction or Yoga

            <br />  Relaxation techniques activate a state of restfulness that counterbalances your body’s fight-or-flight hormones. Consider taking a mindfulness-based stress reduction course to learn effective, lasting tools.<br />

            7. Sleep Enough

            <br />  If you get less than seven to eight hours of sleep, your body won’t tolerate stress as well as it could. If stress keeps you up at night, address the cause and add extra meditation into your day to make up for the lost z’s.<br />

            8. Bond with Your Pet

            <br />  Clinical studies show that spending even a short time with a companion animal can cut anxiety levels almost in half.<br />

            9. Take a Vacation

            <br />Getting away from it all can reset your stress tolerance by increasing your mental and emotional outlook, which makes you a happier, more productive person upon return. Leave your cellphone and laptop at home! <br />

            10. See a Counselor, Coach or Therapist

            <br /> If negative thoughts overwhelm your ability to make positive changes, it’s time to seek professional help. Make an appointment today—your health and life are worth it.<br />

            <h5>BEST EXERCISES TO REDUCE STRESS AT HOME:</h5>

            1. Yoga
            <br />One of the best stress relief exercises to try at home is Yoga. Not only is yoga easy to practice at home but it also enhances our mental focus, which is key to managing stress. When stress swipes in our mind it loses its calm and clouds of chaos hovers.<br />
            <br /><img src=" https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yoga.jpg" height="350px" width="400px"> <br />
            2. Tai Chi
            <br /> Tai Chi has its origin from Chinese martial art, also known as, Tai Chi Chuan. It is often described as “meditation in motion.” This is a low-impact exercise that comprises a series of gentle and fluid movements, linked with your breath. <br />
            <br /><img src="https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tai-Chi.jpg" height="350px"> <br />
            3. Qigong
            <br />Qigong is a stress reducing exercise that is similar to Tai Chi. It is a Chinese martial art technique. It is not a heart-pumping workout that puts our body in movement; rather it is a meditative and deliberate approach for the same.<br />
            <br /><img src="https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Qigong.jpg" height="350px"> <br />
            4. Walking
            <br />Probably one of the easiest and cost-effective exercises to relieve stress is walking! Trust me even if you are walking within the house, balcony, the little backyard that you have, you are going to rejoice the benefits that it has to offer. Studies have time and again showed that people with regular walking regimens tend to report a lower level of stress as compared to those who don’t have walking as a part of their lifestyle.<br />
            <br /><img src="https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Walking.jpg" height="350px"> <br />
            5. Dancing
            <br />I bet many of you just felt experienced that YAY moment reading Dancing in the list. Well, why wouldn’t you? After all, it is a fun way to reduce stress. The best about this exercise is that there is no list of rules, do’s, and don’ts attached to it. Just dance your heart out!<br />
            <br /><img src=" https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dancing.jpg" height="350px"> <br />
            6. Gardening
            <br />Gardening is more than getting your hands dirty! It can help you burn your calories on one hand and uplift your mood on the other (proved scientifically). A study also showed that gardening works amazingly well as an exercise to reduce stress, especially acute stress.<br />
            <br /><img src="https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gardening.jpg" height="350px"> <br />
            7. Pilates
            <br />This exercise to reduce stress has recently gained much recognition to get fit and lead a stress -free life. Pilates can help you with reducing the signs of both stress and anxiety. Along with this it also offers flexibility, improves postures, and heightens mental awareness.<br />
            <br /><img src="https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pilates.jpg" height="350px"> <br />
            8. Tabata Pushup Drill
            <br />If all these exercises to reduce stress are too slow and low impact for you then Tabata Pushup Drill can work for you! It is a vigorous exercise that will de-stress you in a couple of minutes by exhausting your energy.<br />
            <br /><img src=" https://www.calmsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tabata-Pushup-Drill.jpg" height="350px"> <br />
            9. Focus on Breathing
            <br />Thinking what is breathing doing in this list? Well, think of breathing as your body’s personal air conditioner. Not kidding!
