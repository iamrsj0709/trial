            <h4>WHAT CAUSES EMOTIONAL PAIN ?</h4>
            The causes of emotional pain vary widely, and they usually involve a combination of factors.
            For some people, emotional pain is due to a traumatic experience or event, such as a death in the family. It can also result from a wide range of underlying mental health conditions.
            In other cases, certain situations trigger emotional pain or it might be the result of regret, grief, or loss.
            <br />  Or it might be due to following reasons :<br />

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sadness :
                    Sadness is a natural emotion that is associated with loss and disappointment. However, if it doesn't fade with time, it might point to a treatable condition, depression, that can impact your whole body.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Unexpressed Anger :
                    Anger is a basic human emotion. It releases adrenaline, which increases muscle tension and speeds up breathing. This is the "fight" part of the "fight/flight/freeze" response. It can be mobilizing at times; however, if it's not adequately managed, this response can lead to long-term physical consequences.
                </li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <li>
                    Anxiety :
                    As with anger, anxiety and fear both also release adrenaline. This generally results in jumpiness, a tendency to startle easily, the inability to relax (the "flight" response), or a feeling of being immobilized or stuck (the “freeze” response).
                </li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <li>
                    Shame and Guilt :
                    Shame and guilt often result in a feeling of "butterflies" or weight in the stomach. Common among people with addictions, shame leads to and is worsened by the need for secrecy.
                </li>
                <br />

                <h5>COPING UP WITH EMOTIONAL PAIN </h5>
                Emotional pain can often feel as strong as physical pain and at times can even cause symptoms of pain throughout the body. It can also have a detrimental impact on both short-term and long-term mental well-being, so getting appropriate help and treatment is important.

                Because emotional pain can be so distressing, people often turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms, including drugs and alcohol. The problem is that while these methods might provide short-term relief, they cause greater damage in the long run.

                Some healthier ways to manage your symptoms of emotional pain can include:
                <ul>

                    <li>Talking to someone: Social support is critical for emotional well-being, and talking to a trusted person, whether its a good friend or a counselor, can help.</li>

                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Exercising: Physical activity has been shown to be effective for improving mood, so it can be a good way to help deal with feelings of emotional pain.
                        Blowing off feelings of anger with a run around the block is a better choice than acting out aggressively. Taking an afternoon stroll can do more to lift your mood than scrolling endlessly through social media posts.
                    </li>
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    <li>Practicing mindfulness: Mindfulness, a mental practice that involves focusing on the present moment, can be useful when you are trying to cope with difficult emotions such as anxiety, grief, sadness, and anger. The process involves not only becoming more aware of your emotions but also stress learning to accept and let go of the need to control or eliminate these emotions.</li>
                    <br />
